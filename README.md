[Neuromorphic technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_computing) are fascinating new ways to build computers, inspired by the brain.
The ecosystem around neuromorphics is rapidly growing, and we have a unique window of opportunity to build accessible, fast, and reliable software for neuromorphic technologies.
Hacking hours exist to *reduce the friction in the neuromorphic tech stack*. We find and fix issues to improve the general state of the neuromorphic ecosystem - one issue at the time ðŸš€
